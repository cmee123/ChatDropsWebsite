# ChatDrops Website
The ChatDrops Website is a website that contains important information regarding the environmental impacts of AI and what users can do to reduce these impacts. 

# ChatDrops Extension
The ChatDrops extension is a web-based extension that tracks each time a user sends a message to the ChatGPT API to interact with a ChatGPT model. These queries are translated into the equivalent water usage categorized by daily water usage and lifetime water usage through ChatGPT. ChatDrops displays the equivalent water usage in terms of fluid ounces, water bottles, and hand washes. 

# ChatDrops Quiz
The ChatDrops quiz is a short multiple-choice quiz that gathers information about the user's AI usage and habits. Depending on the responses from the user, the results of the quiz vary, giving specific information about the user's AI habits and how they can reduce their AI environmental impact. 

# Requirements

## Usability
### Is your implementation done in a way that a user can navigate and use your website without any additional instructions?

Our website is implemented such that it is easy for users to navigate and use our website without any additional instructions. It's formatted in a way where you are able to scroll to access all important information, as well as click on menu buttons to take you directly to different sections. Our website is broken into multiple sections to guide the user through an interactive and educational experience. 

## Educational Value 
### Does your implementation effectively teach a user about your topic? Does this content make sense for the personas you have developed?

Our implementation effectively teaches the user about our topic, along with informing the user about their own AI usage and what they can do to reduce their environmental impact. The way the information is organized allows the user to first understand the environmental impacts of AI, analyze their own environmental impacts, learn about current legislation, and then what they can do to help. This content makes sense for the personas we developed, as it is appropriate to inform users with minimal AI experience, those who use AI regularly, and as a resource for people to inform them about AI's environmental impacts. 

## Interactivity 
### Does your implementation have interactive elements that enhance the user experience?

Our implementation has multiple interactive elements that enhance the user experience. Firstly, we have an interactive quiz where users answer questions about their AI habits and usage. This quiz outputs an analysis of their AI usage and what actions they could take to reduce their AI usage. Secondly, we have our web extension, ChatDrops, which is implemented in ChatGPT. Every time the user sends a query to ChatGPT, our extension pops up, tracking the number of queries and the estimated environmental impact of those queries. 

## Aesthetics
### Is your implementation visually appealing?

Our implementation is visually appealing. It provides a clean interface that is easy to navigate while still offering visually appealing aesthetics. It utilizes a simple color palette, simplistic logos, and clear formatting.
